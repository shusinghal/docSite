neoDocSite documentation
========================

This document provides guidance on using Neo Trade, a trading setup designed to automate your trading strategy for real-time stock order placement and management.

**Important Disclaimer:**

* This script is for informational purposes only. Using it for actual trading involves inherent risks. We strongly advise against using it without a deep understanding of financial markets and associated risks.
* This documentation does not cover all script functionalities and assumes some Python programming knowledge.

**Prerequisites:**

* A Kotak Securities trading account.
* A Google Cloud VM instance to deploy your code.
* A Telegram bot and account.
* Access to Kotak Neo trading APIs.

**Functionality Overview:**

* **Login:** Establishes a connection with the Kotak Securities API and generates a session.
* **Order Management:**
   * Checks your session's activity.
   * Retrieves open positions.
   * Places orders for new positions or modifies existing ones.
   * Confirms successful order placement and new position activation.
   * Sets Stop-Loss (SL) orders for your positions.
   * Sends Telegram notifications for successful order placement and potential errors.
   * Tracks all activities in a log file.

**How to Use:**

#. **Before You Start:**
     * Ensure a Python environment with required libraries (refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the list).
     * Obtain Kotak Securities API credentials (access token and API sign-in credentials).
     * (Optional) Set up a Telegram account for mobile notifications.

#. **Preparation:**
     * Install the necessary Python libraries.
     * Edit the `credentials.txt` file to enter your sign-in and Telegram credentials.
     * (Optional) Set up Telegram notification functionality if desired (functions like `teleMsgSuccess` and `mayhem` seem to interact with Telegram).
     * Create a crontab in your Google Cloud VM instance to schedule and run the program automatically.

#. **Running the Program:**
     * Use the `stocks.xlsx` file to manage your stocks.
     * The program runs automatically, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
     * (Optional) The program can be configured to close all open positions at the end of the day.

**Notes:**

* The script relies on several helper functions and global variables not explained here. Understanding their logic is crucial for full functionality.
* The script automates login and order placement based on a pre-defined strategy. Carefully review the script code, especially functionalities related to order placement, before use.
* Error handling and notification mechanisms might require adjustments based on your preferences.

**We strongly recommend consulting with a developer familiar with Python and financial APIs before using this script for any trading activities.**
