## Welcome to Neo Trade Documentation

This document provides guidance on using Neo Trade, a trading setup designed to automate your trading strategy for real-time stock order placement and management.

**Important Disclaimer:**

* This script is for informational purposes only. Using it for actual trading involves inherent risks. We strongly advise against using it without a deep understanding of financial markets and associated risks.
* This documentation does not cover all script functionalities and assumes some Python programming knowledge.

**Prerequisites:**

* A Kotak Securities trading account.
* A Google Cloud VM instance to deploy your code.
* A Telegram bot and account.
* Access to Kotak Neo trading APIs.

**Functionality Overview:**

* **Login:** Establishes a connection with the Kotak Securities API and generates a session.
* **Order Management:**
    * Checks your session's activity.
    * Retrieves open positions.
    * Places orders for new positions or modifies existing ones.
    * Confirms successful order placement and new position activation.
    * Sets Stop-Loss (SL) orders for your positions.
    * Sends Telegram notifications for successful order placement and potential errors.
    * Tracks all activities in a log file.

**How to Use:**

1. **Before You Start:**
    * Ensure a Python environment with required libraries (refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the list).
    * Obtain Kotak Securities API credentials (access token and API sign-in credentials).
    * (Optional) Set up a Telegram account for mobile notifications.

2. **Preparation:**
    * Install the necessary Python libraries.
    * Edit the `credentials.txt` file to enter your sign-in and Telegram credentials.
    * (Optional) Set up Telegram notification functionality if desired (functions like `teleMsgSuccess` and `mayhem` seem to interact with Telegram).
    * Create a crontab in your Google Cloud VM instance to schedule and run the program automatically.

3. **Running the Program:**
    * Use the `stocks.xlsx` file to manage your stocks.
    * The program runs automatically, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
    * (Optional) The program can be configured to close all open positions at the end of the day.

**Notes:**

* The script relies on several helper functions and global variables not explained here. Understanding their logic is crucial for full functionality.
* The script automates login and order placement based on a pre-defined strategy. Carefully review the script code, especially functionalities related to order placement, before use.
* Error handling and notification mechanisms might require adjustments based on your preferences.

**We strongly recommend consulting with a developer familiar with Python and financial APIs before using this script for any trading activities.**

**Additional Documentation:**

* `docs/` folder: This folder contains additional markdown pages, images, and other relevant files.

This revision improves clarity by:

* Replacing "Welcome to neo trade documentation" with a more formal title.
* Using active voice for better readability.
* Breaking down long sentences for easier comprehension.
* Adding a section on additional documentation.
