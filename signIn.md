**Generating a Trading Session**
================================

This process ensures a valid trading session for order placement. Here's how it works:

1. **Existing Session Check**: The system first verifies if an existing trading session is available. It considers the following criteria:
    * **Session File Availability**: Checks if the session file exists.
    * **Session Date Validity**: Ensures the date stored in the session file matches today's date.

   If any of these conditions are not met, a new session will be generated.

2. **New Session Generation**: If no valid existing session is found, the program leverages your credentials to create a new session. A typical session remains valid for 24 hours, unless you choose a different timeframe.

3. **Session Re-use**: Throughout the trading process, the program periodically checks for your session's validity to ensure uninterrupted operation and prevent trading errors.
