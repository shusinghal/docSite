<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Everyone loves the idea of making quick money in the stock market. But how? There are countless channels selling the secret to success. Do they work? Well, it depends on your luck, right? The best way to test a strategy is to see how it performed in the past. However, history doesn’t account for our fear and greed. So maybe, just maybe, if I can keep my emotions aside, I have a small chance of success.</p>
<p>Should I take the risk? No, because the chances of success are slim. And failure is demotivating. But do I have other options? Yes, there are long-term options available. Thoughts on those? Forget it. I have only one life, and I can’t lock my money away to live a mediocre adulthood. I’ll get returns when I’m old and too weak to enjoy anything. I need money now and prefer to invest for the short term.</p>
<p>Can I do daily trading? Yes. Will the secret strategy give me positive returns every day? No, that would be too greedy. Honestly, I was considering a one-year timeframe. If it gives me 10-15% returns in one year, I’ll be happy. This brings me to my application.</p>
<p>I randomly sampled some algorithms to test how they performed over a year. I also tested them on various stocks to ensure they were worth the risk. Though I haven’t started yet, I was already thinking in terms of lakhs and crores. On the other hand, since this was my first step, I didn’t want to spend on tools and services. That’s why I created this application.</p>
<p>To keep it simple, the application has three main components:
* Login
* Compute trade parameters using an algorithm
* Execute the trade</p>
<p>I tried my best to keep the application modular so I can apply different algorithms when the first one is successful. This application is best suited for personal use only. It does what I need to invest, but doesn’t provide any visual representation of what’s happening.</p>
