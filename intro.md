Everybody loves to earn quick money in stock market. But how? There are countless channels selling the secret sauce to success. Does these work? Ummm it depends on your luck. Right? The best way to test a recipe is to find out how it worked in history. But the history doesn't considers our fear and greed. So may be, just may be, if I can keep my emotions aside, I have a little chance to success. 

Should I take it? No because there are little chances. And failure is demotivating. But do I have other options? Yes, long term options are there. Thoughts on it? Fuck that. I have only one life and I can't lock money to live a mediocre adulthood. I'll get returns when I am old and weak enough that I couldn't enjoy anything. I need money in hand and invest for short time. 

Can I do daily trading? Yes. Will secret sauce give me positive returns everyday? No. That would be too much greedy. Honestly, I was considering a year of timeframe. If it gives 10-15% returns in one year, I will be happy. That bring me to this application.

I randomly sampled some algorithms to test how they performed over a year. I also tested on various stocks to make sure they are worth risk taking. Though I didn't start yet, I was already thinking in terms of lakhs and crores. But on the other side, since I was taking first step, I didn't want to spend on tools and services. That's why I created this application.

To keep it simple, the application has three legs.
* Login
* Compute trade parameters using algorithm 
* Take the trade 

I tried my best to keep the application modular so I can apply different algorithms when first one is successful. This application is best suited for personal use only. It do what I need to invest, but doesn't give any visual representation of what's happening.
